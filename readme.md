## Features

### # সাবলিল বর্ন বিন্যাস
Which is very similar to phonetic typing.

### # Unicode
Unicode type which is universally supported and not ASCII mod, which causes many issues.

### # Double key modifiers
**Q** and **Left Shift** keys as modifiers to support Bengali letters. **Q** is easier to use as a modifier, also it's easier when you have to press **Q** and **Left Shift** together to write different letters.

### # Natural
Qtype uses natural compound letter typing with no modification and uses **x** to write compound letters.

ক ->  ্ -> ষ = ক্ষ [k -> x -> q+s]

 | Key Combination | Letters | Letter |
 | --------------- | ------- | ------ |
 | k x q+s         | ক   ্  ষ | ক্ষ     |
 | q+y x c         | ঞ ্ চ    | ঞ্চ     |
